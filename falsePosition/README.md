# False Position Algorithm for MECH 105
This Matlab function uses the ancient method of false position to return a root of a given anonymous function over certain bounds. The bounds must bracket a root of the function otherwise the function will fail. For me information about this method see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_position_method.
