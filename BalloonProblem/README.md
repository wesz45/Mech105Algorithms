# Balloon
This algorithm is designed to solve a set of problems designed around hot air balloons. The solution is generated using Euler's method, so a significant error is incurred, but it gives the right intuition around which one might use a more particular method. Noteworthy inputs include initial and final times, initial upward velocity and height, as well as a step size. Optional inputs include the Bouyancy force generated by the hot air, the gravitational force on the balloon, the mass of the balloon, a drag coefficient, and masses for both payload, jettisoned material, and a height at which material was jettisoned.
